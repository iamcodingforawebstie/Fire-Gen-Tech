                <h3>We got just that!</h3><hr>
            <p>Our experienced professionals have been carefully training the AI for a couple of years, and it gets results
                that are great! Yes, we have actually tested it in an actuall medical center and out of 50 samples, the
                AI was able to detect 49 of them right, and it has detected a diease that even previous AI models
                were confused about. The price of these new AI model machines for medical centers? $100,000. But luckily, we
                offer them for free for the hospitals that can't afford them. This is because we believe health care should be 
                accessable everywhere. Order today at the Our Products, and our team will be ready to provide you with our tech!</p>
