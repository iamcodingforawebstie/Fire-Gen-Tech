            <h3> So what is our purpose?</h3><hr>
            <p>We, Fire Generation Technologies, make advanced tech devices for hospitals and medical centers. Although
                we sell laptops for consumers, we care more about health, because our goal is to intergrate AI within
                hospitals and medical centers to identify diseases using methods that normal methods would miss.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="boxes">
            <h3>Is this non-profit?</h3><hr>
            <p>Yes! Although we do charge for consumer electronics, our main goal is to help get rid of diseases that are 
                hard to detect and are costing millions of lives. Unfourtunatly, some medical centers can't afford our 
                AI. So we decided to make them free for hospitals and medical centers that can't affford the price.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="boxes">
            <h3>What type of consumer technologies do we sell?</h3><hr>
            <p>When we started selling laptops, we thought of 2 things: <b>Lightweight</b> and <b>fast</b>. So
                we kept that in mind when we started manufacturing laptops. Making the laptops was easy, but choosing
                the software was hard. Also, we ran into problems when making the processor, as using regular x64 
                processors would be difficult. So we decided to make our own OS, and our own processor. This new software
                called <b>Fire level</b> would be our new processor, which is insanly fast. We expected when we released 
                them into the market, it wouldn't get popular, but just 5 days later, we sold out because our laptops
                were so popular! Why? Because our OS and processor was using cutting-edge technology collabriating 
                with advanced deep AI to speed up the device while keeping it slim.</p>
