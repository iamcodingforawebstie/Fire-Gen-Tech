            <h3>MRI AI Machine</h3><hr>
            <p>We have taken a look at regular MRI machines, and we thought about the problems with this machine, and solutions.

                we got an MRI machine and we started intergrating AI into the hardware of the macine and what is the result?
                A much more acurate MRI machine!
